 *This is simulation of how a vacuum cleaner can move *
 *Through a pre defined space from the user           *
 *The Work Space is initialized in a Random way       *
 *The number of dirts and obstacles generated randomly*
 *The Start point of the Vacuum is randomly generated *
 *The direction of the vacuum generated randomly      *
